expected goal:-
1) creating a full fledge e-commerce website experience where a user can login and register,
   everytime a user login he is assigned with jwt token , his/her passwords are hashed using
   bycrypt,
2) Filter , Sort and search bar would work properly.

goals achievend :-
1) ecommerce website layout where it's fetching products detials from fakestore api,
   It's a single page website and it doesn't reload as I have user Browser Router.
2) backend is 95% complete , I only needed to add jwt but could not do so as Front end
   is not getting connected to backend , You can go through my porject and you can see for yourself that my approach
   is correct.
3) A user can add product to cart and to his/her wishlist.

goals that will be achieved :-
1) Realistically I only had one day if I can get more time I can built what I was expecting.

how to run the prjoect :-
1) client :- goto terminal and make sure you are inside client folder and install node modules,
   type "npm install". Once it's installed type "npm start".
2) server : goto terminal and make sure you are inside server folder and type "npm run dev".
